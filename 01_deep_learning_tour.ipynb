    "\n",
    "This exercise is inspired by Baig et al. (2020) <i>The Deep Learning Workshop</i> from <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-deep-learning-workshop/9781839219856\">Packt Publishers</a> (Exercise 1.01, page 7).\n",

    "## Deep learning for image recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into exactly _how_ deep learning works, let's explore it through an example. We will explore just a few of the fantastic things you can do with existing models and see how easy it can be to implement AI tools with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use a pre-trained deep learning model, [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which has been trained on [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/), a collection of about 1.3 million images labeled as being in one of 1,000 categories. We won't focus on the details of ResNet50, but understand that it is a deep learning image classification model developed to categorize images into one of the 1,000 categories in the ImageNet dataset. Like many models, it is openly available and can be seamlessly imported into your notebook with or without the learned weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this exercise, let us introduce you to our heroine,  Dr. Amelia. <img alt=\"A cartoon of Dr. Amelia, a nutrition researcher, sitting at a computer thinking about food items which appear in a thought bubble.\" src=\"images/DrAmelia.jpg\" padding=20 align=\"right\" width=250>\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia is a research nutritionist who is conducting a dietary study in which she analyzes her participants' diets. Experience has shown her that when asked to report the details of their meals, participants frequently either do not enter the data or misreport what they ate. For Amelia's new study, she hopes to have them take photos of their meals and use AI to analyze their diet automatically. As a first step, she wants to test a model to see how well it can recognize a food item from a photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Amelia doesn't have much data yet but has learned that using pre-trained models for many tasks is possible, and she hopes to avoid starting her project from scratch. As a prototype, we will help Amelia develop her AI-powered food recognition system!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Dr. Amelia's cartoon was generated with AI's assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia is a *Practicum AI* alumna and recalls the AI Application Development Pathway. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Practicum AI Application Pathway Image](images/application_dev_pathway.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "With her food image processing task, she has already completed Step 1: Choose a Problem! Due to the flexible nature of coding, implementing the following steps will jump around a bit. Don't worry; Amelia knows her stuff and will ensure we know where we are in the development process. Here is an overview of the steps in the application development process and how they correspond to the code in this Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a Problem - Make a food item classifier that takes an input image and returns the predicted food object!\n",
    "2. Gather Good Data - Amelia is very busy; she doesn't have time to take thousands of food images! Instead, she will use a model that has already been trained to \"recognize\" various food items (and hundreds of other things!).\n",
    "3. Clean and Prep Data - The model she is using already has training data, so she doesn't need to worry about prepping her training data. However, she will have to work to ensure that her new inputs are formatted correctly.\n",
    "4. Choose a Model - Amelia needs a model that is already trained and recognizes images. That narrows her search to models like ResNet (though there is an ever-growing list of possibilities here!).\n",
    "5. Train the Model - Our heroine will use a pre-trained model, so... Done! She is up and running with an AI application without compiling or training anything.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the Model - As part of the evaluation process, Amelia will need to test the model to see how well it recognizes food.\n",
    "7. Deploy the Model - Amelia is comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks, so she will leave the application here for this initial proof of concept. Embedding the model in another application is unnecessary (and beyond the scope of this course!).\n",

    "> While you may not be looking to classify food items (or have a very different AI project in mind), note that in many cases, there are models with which you start. The relative openness of AI researchers in sharing their models has enabled the community to:\n",
    ">   * Use a trained model \"out of the box,\" as Amelia will.\n",

    "> Rarely is there a need to start from scratch!\n",

    "## 1. Import libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the necessary libraries. For this exercise, Amelia will use the pre-trained ResNet50 model that is part of Keras: `tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50`. Check out the [Keras documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet50/ResNet50) for more details. \n",

It was introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem commonly faced when training very deep neural networks. As networks become deeper, gradients (the values used to update network weights) can become extremely small, effectively halting training. \n",
    "> ResNet introduces the concept of \"residual blocks.\"  As it processes data, instead of relying solely on the current \"thought\" or layer, it can also \"refer back\" to earlier layers, much like using recent memories to help recall older ones. These \"references back\" are called skip connections. They act like bridges, letting the network jump over some layers to ensure that even as it delves deeper into processing, it remembers and retains important early details. This shortcut or skip connection allows gradients to propagate more easily through the network. \n",
    "> This architectural innovation has enabled the training of networks with depths previously thought infeasible. With hundreds or even thousands of layers, ResNet models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many image classification benchmarks. \n",

The advantage here is that you typically need far less data to train a model to recognize many food types, for example, when it already knows about food and many other things in the world!\n",
