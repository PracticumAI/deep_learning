    "This exercise is inspired by Baig et al. (2020) <i>The Deep Learning Workshop</i> from <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-deep-learning-workshop/9781839219856\">Packt Publishers</a> (Exercise 1.01, page 7).\n",

    "## Deep learning for image recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into exactly _how_ deep learning works, let's explore it through an example. We will explore just a few of the fantastic things you can do with existing models and see how easy it can be to implement AI tools with code. \n",
    "\n",
    " In this exercise, we will use a pre-trained deep learning model, [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which has been trained on [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/), a collection of about 1.3 million images labeled as being in one of 1,000 categories. We won't focus on the details of ResNet50, but understand that it is a deep learning image classification model that was developed to categorize images into one of the 1,000 categories found in the ImageNet dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this exercise, let us introduce you to Amelia. <img alt='A GAN-generated cartoon image of Amelia, our character for this exercise.' src='images/amelia.png' align='right' width=300 style=\"float: right; padding: 10px 0px 0px 10px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia, our teenaged, tech geek heroine, is an extremely picky eater. She's something of a pizza fanatic 🍕! When dinner time rolls around, she only wants to come down from her bedroom if pizza is on the menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a tech geek, Amelia has installed a hidden camera in the dining room.  Once dinner is set, the camera snaps a photo of the meal.  Now, she wants to develop an AI image recognition system to determine whether pizza is served.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's help Amelia code her pizza recognition system!\n",

    "With her pizza-recognizing hidden camera, she's already completed Step 1: Choose a Problem! Due to the flexible nature of coding, implementing the next six steps will jump around a bit. Don't worry though, Amelia knows her stuff and will ensure we know where we're at in the application process. Here's the overview of the steps in the application development process and how they correspond to the code in this Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "1. Choose a Problem - Making a pizza recognizer!\n",
    "2. Gather Good Data - Amelia is just a teenager; she can't afford to take thousands of images of pizza and other objects and train a model from scratch! Instead, she will use a model that's already been trained to \"recognize\" pizza (and 999 additional categories).\n",
    "3. Clean and Prep Data - Amelia's selected model was already trained on the large set of images in ImageNet, so she doesn't need to worry about prepping her training data. She will, however, need to do some work to ensure that her new inputs are formatted correctly.\n",
    "4. Choose a Model - Amelia realizes that she can take advantage of a model that's already trained, and doesn't need to start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> While you may not be looking to classify pizza images (or have a very different AI project in mind) note that in most cases, there are probably models you can build from. The relative openness of AI researchers in sharing their models has enabled the community to:\n",
    ">   * Use a trained model \"out of the box\" as Amelia will.\n",
    ">   * Fine tune a model with some of your data.\n",
    ">   * Use an existing model architecture and train with your data.\n",
    ">   * Modify an existing model architecture and train with your data.\n",
    "> Rarely is there a need to start from scratch!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train the Model - Our heroine is going to use a model that's pre-trained so... Done! She's up and running with an AI application without needing to compile or train anything. Magic!\n",
    "6. Evaluate the Model - As part of the evaluation process, Amelia will need to test the model to see how well it recognizes pizza.\n",
    "7. Deploy the Model - Since Amelia is comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks, she's going to leave the application here. Embedding the model in another application is unnecessary (and beyond the scope of this course!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Import libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the necessary libraries. For this exercise, Amelia will use the pre-trained ResNet50 model that is part of Keras: `from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50`.

It was introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem commonly faced when training very deep neural networks. As networks become deeper, gradients (the values used to update network weights) can become extremely small, effectively halting training. \n",
    "> ResNet introduces the concept of \"residual blocks.\"  As it processes data, instead of relying solely on the current \"thought\" or layer, it can also \"refer back\" to earlier layers, much like using recent memories to help recall older ones. These \"references back\" are called skip connections. They act like bridges, letting the network jump over some layers to ensure that even as it delves deeper into processing, it doesn't forget or lose important early details. This shortcut or skip connection allows gradients to propagate more easily through the network. \n",
    "> This architectural innovation has enabled the training of networks with depths previously thought unfeasible. ResNet models, with hundreds or even thousands of layers, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many image classification benchmarks. \n",
